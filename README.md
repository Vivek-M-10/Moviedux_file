Hello GitHub Support,

I would like to request the permanent removal (purge) of a deleted repository from GitHub systems, including caches, forks, GitHub Pages, GitHub Actions artifacts, and backups.

Repository: https://github.com/<org>/<repo-name>

The repository has already been deleted, but we require a full purge from GitHubâ€™s servers.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,  
<Your Name / Org>
